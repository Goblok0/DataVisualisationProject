### Purpose
* The purpose of this site and the underlying respective programming is to give the user more insight on their watching habits, according to their own [MyAnimeList](https://myanimelist.net). This is given by several visualizations each serving their own purpose. The Barchart can give insight about genre and studio preferences, which genres you prefer to watch in the future and which genres or studios you are likely to put on hold or stop watching midway through the serie itself. The Heatmap can give insight on seasonal viewing habits, most likely due to free time or which seasons make you feel more inclined to watch series. The Linechart gives a more concrete view on yearly viewing habits than the Heatmap and gives you a tool to compare certain genres with other genres, unlike the heatmap. A note should be made that the years and seasonal numbers represent the date of release of the series, and not necessarily the moment you watched it yourself, however noticable peaks in certain years or seasons are still representative of your viewing habits.
