        Problem: <br><br>
        The MyAnimeList(MAL) site allows users to keep track of the anime they've seen.
        However it does not give a lot of insight into your preferences and watch patterns,
        especially when the account owner has seen over a 100 different series.
        Mainly due to a lack of visualization tools on the site itself, which also
        results in not being able to compare to other users.
        <br><br>
        These visualizations can give insight on genre and studio preferences.
        For genre specifically in the context of total amount, seasonal and yearly specifics.

        About MAL: <br><br>
        Within MAL you can categorize different series witin different lists
        to keep track of the anime series you've seen, put on-hold, dropped or
        planned to watch. Furthermore it gives extensive details from synopsis to
        staff members and overall popularity within the site itself.<br>
        The data is obtained by scraper, however it is currently not possible to
        call the scraper in the site or use other data besides the already
        scraped data.
